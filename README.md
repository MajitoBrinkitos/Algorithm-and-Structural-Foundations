Solving two LeetCode problems using JavaScript

## Sort an Array

### Purpose
This code modifies the array sortArray to return all items in ascending order.

### Function Nesting
The function sortingNums is nested within sortArray and is responsible for returning the sorted array.

### Parameters
The parameters LEFT to RIGHT store the indices for comparison in the sorting process.

### Sorting Process
the sorting process involves comparing elements of the original array and rearranging them in ascending order. this is done with a while loop.

### Pivot and Indices
I and D represent the indices around the pivot element X, which helps in partitioning the array for sorting.
